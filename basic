  # Practice

    - It will take more than merely reading documentation to make you an expert.

    - Instead, let's to practice. This training includes a tons of exercises.

    - If you are attending a workshop or a trainer-led class: follow instructions to access the environment.

    - If you are doing this on your own: use [Play with Docker](http://labs.play-with-docker.com/). It's a complete working envinronment for free.

    - Use the on-line [Docker Lab Tutorials](http://tutorial.docker.noverit.com/) for practice.

  # Environment

  For a trainer-led class, use the cluster on the Google Cloud Platform. Each attendee will get his/her own cluster made of 3 CentOS virtual machines:
  
    1. swarm-userXX-node00
    2. swarm-userXX-node01
    3. swarm-userXX-node02
  
  To access these nodes from a Linux or Mac machine, login via SSH to the bastion server with the key "gcp.pem" provided by the instructor:
  
  ```bash
  ssh -i gcp.pem userXX@docker.noverit.com
  ```
  
  and then access the machines with the same user
  
  ```bash
  ssh userXX@swarm-userXX-node00
  ```
  
  From a Windows machine, use a terminal like *putty.exe* with the ssh key "gcp.ppk" provided by the instructor and login to the bastion server, then access the machines as above.
